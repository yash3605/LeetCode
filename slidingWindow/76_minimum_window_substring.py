LeetCode #76: Minimum Window Substring

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

Constraints:
m == s.length, n == t.length, 1 <= m, n <= 10^5, s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
